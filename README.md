# Hanging Light Animation

This project showcases an interactive animation of hanging lights that dangle as you hover over them with your cursor. The animation is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on CodePen.

## How It Works

The animation consists of multiple lightbulbs hanging from the top. When you hover your cursor over a lightbulb, it starts to sway and move, creating a realistic dangling effect. The lights return to their original position when the cursor moves away.

## Features

- Realistic hanging light animation.
- Interactive and responsive to cursor movements.
- Smooth transitions and animations.

## Usage

To use this animation in your own project, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the HTML and CSS code from the CodePen link and paste it into your HTML and CSS files, respectively.

2. Add the JavaScript code to your project to handle the hovering effect and animations.

3. Customize the appearance of the lights, their colors, and the hanging mechanism as per your project's requirements.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance the animation or add new features are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue on the CodePen repository.

Enjoy the mesmerizing effect of the hanging light animation! Happy coding!
